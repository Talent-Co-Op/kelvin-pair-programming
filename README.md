**Problem Description:**

**Title:** Maximizing Luck Balance

**Description:**

In this problem, Lena is preparing for a programming competition and she has a list of contests to participate in. Each contest has an associated luck value, which represents how important the contest is to Lena's preparation. Lena can win or lose a contest, and winning a contest adds its luck value to her "luck balance," while losing a contest subtracts its luck value.

The goal is to help Lena maximize her luck balance while still participating in at most `k` important contests.

**Time to Complete:**

This problem is expected to be solved within 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the candidate's familiarity with algorithms and problem-solving skills.

**Purpose of the Task:**

The purpose of this task is to assess the candidate's ability to design an algorithm to solve a specific problem, considering both the value of the contests and their importance. It tests their problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency.

**Expectations:**

- The candidate should provide a Python function `maximize_luck_balance` that takes a list of contests and an integer `k` as input and returns an integer representing the maximum luck balance Lena can achieve.
- The function should handle different edge cases and scenarios, including contests with different importance levels, and determine the optimal strategy for Lena to maximize her luck balance.
- The code should be clean, well-organized, and readable. Comments may be added if necessary to explain the logic.
- The candidate should also demonstrate an understanding of list manipulation and algorithmic complexity.
