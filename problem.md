### Problem
Lena is preparing for a programming competition and she has a list of contests to participate in. Each contest has an associated luck value. The luck value represents how important the contest is to Lena's preparation. Lena can win or lose a contest. Winning a contest adds its luck value to her "luck balance," while losing a contest subtracts its luck value.

Lena wants to maximize her luck balance while still participating in at most k important contests. Write a function `maximize_luck_balance` to help Lena achieve this.  


```python
def maximize_luck_balance(contests: List[Tuple[int, int]], k: int) -> int:
    pass
```


**Input:**
- `contests`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `L[i]` and `T[i]`, representing the luck value of the contest and its importance (1 for important, 0 for unimportant) respectively. (1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, 0 <= `T[i]` <= 1)
- `k`: The maximum number of important contests Lena can lose.
  
If Lena loses all of the contests, her will be `5 + 1 + 4 = 10`. Since she is allowed to lose `2` important contests, and there are only `2` important contests, she can lose all three contests to maximize her luck at `10`.  
If `k = 1`, she has to win at least `1` of the `2` important contests. She would choose to win the lowest value important contest worth `1`. Her final luck will be `5 + 4 - 1 = 8`.  
   

**Output:**
- Returns an integer representing the maximum luck balance Lena can achieve.


**Example:**
```python 
contests = [(5, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (8, 0), (10, 0), (5, 0)]
k = 3
maximize_luck_balance(contests, k)  # Output: 29
```

**Explanation**:  
Lena can lose at most 3 important contests. The optimal strategy is to lose the three important contests with the smallest luck values, which will give her a maximum luck balance of `29`. (5 + 2 + 1 + 10 + 5 + 8 = 31 - 2 - 1 - 5 = 29)
